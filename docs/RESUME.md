# Resume note

Scratch state for work that is **in flight right now**. Kept in git so it
survives a killed turn, a dead session, and a fresh clone.

`docs/BACKLOG.md` says what should happen and stays tidy. This file is allowed
to be messy: it is the thought that would otherwise only exist in a context
window, and a context window does not survive the usage limit being hit
mid-turn.

**Keep it current while working**, not at the end - the end is exactly the part
that does not always arrive. Update it whenever the answer to "what am I doing
and what's next" changes materially. When the work lands, clear it back to the
placeholder line below.

The scheduled Desktop task's prompt reads this file first, so stale content
here sends an unattended run after work that is already done. Clear it.

_Nothing in flight._

**Do not run Question 17's concurrency=1 control run.** It was the "next up" here
until 2026-08-03 and is now unnecessary: Question 17 was answered from the
archived run log instead (`tmp/frage16-run.log`, 4/4 correlation with
`warnShowAllTruncated`). Server-side variance is refuted, so there is nothing for
that run to rule out. No env knob needed, no probe change needed.

**Question 18 is closed and its alarm was false** - no files were ever missing
there, the detector was counting table rows instead of file rows and flagging an
enrolment table. Fixed and re-verified live the same day. If you find an older
note claiming the 345-file ground truth is short, it is wrong; that was my
prediction, and the run refuted it.

Next up, already decided and needing nobody: **Question 19**
(`docs/sync-speed-model.md`) - Question 17's remaining tail, and the last
unexplained real file loss. Under `course_concurrency=2` a paginated folder
returns the same 41 rows it started with and drops six files, twice out of four
runs; at `concurrency=1` the same node expands correctly to 44. Open question is
whether the "show all" click is dropped or whether its answer arrives after the
read. Needs click-level logging plus a contention run to reproduce, and the
failure is intermittent so expect repeats. Prediction and failure criterion are
already written down in the model file - read them before running, not after.
